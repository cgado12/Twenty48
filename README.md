This is a modified clone of the game 2048, which can be seen here: [2048](https://2048game.com/)! This project is built using React, Typescript, and Sass. This also gave me an excuse to give [recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil) a try for managing theme state, which is persisted with localstorage.

*Thanks [hFriedman13](https://github.com/Hfriedman13), for your collaboration in theming and testing!:heart:*
